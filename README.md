# Data Structure, Sort & Search(Python-Flask)

Greeting! I'm Wilson Wong from Hong Kong, and this is my *first* project! 

It is a **webpage** demonstrating simple data structure, sorting time and searching time utilizing **Python**, **Flask** and **SQLite**.

Due to budget consideration, it is only hosts on local host. In other words, you have to follow command line in "CLI.rtf" so as to install and run the webpage.
